        <h2>Ministries</h2>
        <br/>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Liturgical music is an integral part of our worship celebrations. Voices, cantors, and musicians
            of all ages are welcome. Anyone interested in sharing their musical gift is encouraged to offer their talents
            to the parish.</p>
        <p>Please contact Mary Ann Llamedo for more information.</p>

        <h3>Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion</h3>
        <p>Parishioners assist with the distribution of the Eucharist (Body and Blood) at weekday, weekend and Holy Days
            of Obligations Masses. Extraordinary MInisters of Holy Communion (also known as Eucharistic Ministers) must be
            18 years of age, have received the Sacrament of Confirmation in the Catholic Church, and, if married, must be
            recognized by the Church. Training is on-going.</p>
        <p>Please contact Cleo Bala-Casino for more information.</p>

        <h3>Lector</h3>
        <p>Lectors proclaim the Word of the Lord during the Liturgy, and, when there is no Deacon present, the
            General Intercessions. A lector must have a passion for Scripture, an ability to interpret and understand
            Scripture, and sufficient public speaking skills to proclaim the Word to the assembly.</p>
        <p>Training on the specifics of the ministry is provided throughout the year. Parishioners are trained to proclaim
            the Word of God at all Masses. Lectors are provided with the Lector Handbook to assist in their proclamation
            and pronunciation.</p>
        <p>Please contact Gloria Rodrigues for more information.</p>

        <h3>Altar Server</h3>
        <p>Altar Servers offer service to God and the community by assisting the priest during Mass. This ministry is open
            to all youth of the parish who have made their First Communion and whose parents believe they are ready to
            serve and are responsible enough to be trained.</p>
        <p>Young men and women assist the Priest and Deacon at the altar for all weekend, Holy Days of Obligation,
            and special occasion masses. Adults assist during the weekday masses or at special masses when no Altar
            Servers are available.</p>
        <p>Please contact Angie Balbuena for more information.</p>

        <h3>Hospitality</h3>
        <p>Hospitality ministers are the first person one meets when they arrive at the church for any celebration.
            Their warm, friendly smile and welcoming handshake set the tone for the worship and experience.</p>
        <p>A pleasant, outgoing personality is important for greeters, who may also assist with ushering at any given
            Sunday Mass or special occasion. Ushers assist at each Saturday vigil and Sunday Masses, Holy Days of Obligation,
            and other special occasion Masses as needed. Responsibilities include directing crowd flow and movement,
            offertory of the gifts, assisting those with special needs, and directing traffic in the parking lot.</p>
        <p>Please contact Karen Correia-Lemana for more information.</p>

        <h3>Liturgical Environment</h3>
        <p>The Liturgical Environment Ministry is responsible for the church&#8217;s visual enhancement throughout the different
            liturgical seasons and annual celebrations through Altar and other ornaments, flowers, plants, etc. This ministry&#8217;s
            goal is to create an inviting and fitting environment of worship, a place that is suited for sacred celebrations,
            that is dignified and beautiful. This ministry strives to provide an ambiance of tranquility and beauty that prepares
            the human heart to receive God&#8217;s word so the parishioners can enter more fully into communion with God and focus on
            the liturgy and prayer.</p>
        <p>Please contact Roselani Ramones for more information.</p>

        <h2>Councils</h2>
        <br/>
        <h3>Finance</h3>
        <p>The Finance Council is parallel to the Pastoral Council and assists the Pastor with the management of parish funds.
            Using the Parish Pastoral Plan as a guide, they do long-range financial planning to help ensure that the funds needed
            to achieve their goals are available. They work with the parish ministry leaders to help them create budgets that
            reflect the goals for their particular ministries.</p>
        <p>If funds need to be raised, they oversee any development efforts in the parish. They monitor the spending of the funds
            and provide the Pastoral Council with information needed for their assessment and evaluation responsibilities. Thus,
            the Finance Council Representative attends Pastoral Council meetings in order to keep the line of communication open
            between the Finance Council and the Pastoral Council, to be a link to the Finance Council about deliberations that
            have financial implications with the ultimate goal that the Finance Council and the Pastoral Council work in synchrony.</p>

        <h3>Pastoral</h3>
        <p>The parish Pastoral Council is an advisory group to the Pastor regarding the spiritual life of the
            parish on issues of Liturgy and Prayer, Faith Formation, Outreach and Care, and Stewardship in relation to the
            overall mission/vision of the parish.</p>

        <h3>Stewardship</h3>
        <p>TBD</p>
